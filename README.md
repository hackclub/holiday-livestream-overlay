## Holiday Livestream Overlay

This site is used as our holiday stream overlay!

Last year Hack Club staff ran a livestream from our HQ in Shelburne, Vermont over the holidays. This year we'll make a livestream that anyone can modify by writing the code in this repo.

- make a bunch of emojis
- show messages posted in #holiday-stream-team, or another part of the Slack
- change the music
- show the latest scrapbook post in the corner
- everytime someone reacts to a scrapbooked post, rain that emoji down on stream
- change the lights outside
